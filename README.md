# PYTester

PYTester is a fully functional python-based testing suite that is currently in development.

TODO List:
- Add more text builtin handlers with more customizable options
- Add a graphics-based builtin handler
- Add support for batch cases (idk maybe?)
- Add ways to generate randomized test cases quickly
- Lots of documentation for functions and whatnot
- Find a way to package this into something that can be more easily transported
- Test (submission) ids

Feel free to give your own feedback below!
